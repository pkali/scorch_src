EEEK!
AACCH!
I HATE IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS.
ONE DIRECT HIT CAN RUIN YOUR WHOLE DAY.
OH NO!
NOT ME!
OUCH.
OH NO, NOT AGAIN.
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST.
GOODBYE.
HELP ME!
FAREWELL, CRUEL WORLD.
REMEMBER THE ALAMO!
OH MAN!
DOOUGH!
ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER BOMB.
THIS IS THE END, MY ONLY FRIEND.
IT'S ALL OVER.
THE FAT LADY SANG.
WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAPPEN TO ME?
I'M GOING DOWN.
I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS.
CRAPOLA.
POW!
BIF!
BAM!
ZONK!
I SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO MY MOTHER...
NO... A BUD LIGHT!
WHAT WAS THAT NOISE?
MAMA SAID THERE'D BE DAYS LIKE THIS.
ITS JUST ONE OF THOSE DAYS...
I SEE A BRIGHT LIGHT...
MOMMY? IS THAT YOU?
I LET YOU HIT ME!
SUCKER SHOT!
I DIDN'T WANT TO LIVE ANYWAY.

WAS THAT AS CLOSE AS I THINK IT WAS?
JOIN THE ARMY, SEE THE WORLD THEY SAID.
IT WASN'T JUST A JOB IT WAS AN ADVENTURE!
I DIDN'T LIKE VIOLENCE ANYWAY!
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED ME?
SUCH SENSELESS VIOLENCE!  I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
I THINK THIS GUY'S A LITTLE CRAZY.
SOMEHOW I DON'T FEEL LIKE KILLING ANYMORE.
HEY!  KILLIN' AIN'T COOL.
GEE... THANKS.
I'VE FALLEN AND I CAN'T GET UP!
911?
OH NO!  HERE I BLOW AGAIN!
I'LL BE BACK...
HEY - I'VE GOT LAWYERS.
TIME TO CALL 1-900-SUE-TANK.
